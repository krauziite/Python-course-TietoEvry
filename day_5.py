# Write a program to recognize a text symbol
# The user (first player) enters the text.
# Only asterisks instead of letters are output.
# Assume that there are no numbers, but there may be spaces.
# The user (i.e. the other player) enters the symbol.
# If the letter is found, then the letter is displayed in ALL the appropriate places, all other letters remain asterisks.
# Example:
# First input: KartupeÄ¼u lauks -> ********* *****
# Second input: a -> *a****** *a***

# Write a program for text conversion
# Save user input
# Print the entered text without changes
# Exception: if the words in the input are not .... bad, then the output is not ...  bad section must be changed to is good
# Examples:
# The weather is not bad -> The weather is good
# The car is not new -> The car is not new
# This cottage cheese is not so bad -> This cottage cheese is good
# Hints:
# Find (or index, or even rfind) will probably come in handy, as may an operator. Also slice syntax will be useful.
# Extra: How would you do this task in Latvian language (nav slikts/a -> ir labs/a)?
